# Chapter 06. Maven Assemblies

* Maven provides an extensive architecture via plugins and lifecycles.
* The JAR plugin creates  an artifact with .jar extension and the relevant metadata, accroding to the JAR specification 
* In fact, the JAR file is a ZIP file with the optional META-INF directory
* The JAR file aggregates a set of class files to build a single distribution unit
* The WAR file aggregates a set of JAR files, Java classes, JSPs, images, any many more resources into a single distribution unit that can be deployed in a Java EE application server
* However, when you build a product, you might need to aggregate many JAR file from different places, WAR files, README files, LICENSE files, and many more into a single ZIP file
* To build such an archive, we can user Maven assembly plugin
